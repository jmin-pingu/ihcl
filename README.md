# ihcl: an agent-based LLM CLI tool to tailor cover letters for jobs

Why spend 5 minutes rewriting a cover letter for jobs when I can spend days working on a project that automates the process for me? Engineering logic at its finest. 

As a fun puzzle, guess what ihcl stands for!

In all seriousness, this is a project both for my personal utility and a demonstration of how to leverage agentic workflows.
